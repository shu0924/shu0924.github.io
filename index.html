            Program parallelization is vital to computing efficiency and to the performance of applications. Coarse-grained speculative 
            parallelization is applied to speed up the process of Finite State Machine (FSM)-based computations. In detail, we can cut 
            the input string into the length of segments, equals to the length of len(input) / cores, predict the start state with lookback, 
            parallel execution, and validation and reprocessing. With such a coarse-grained speculative parallelization, we can reduce time and 
            efficiency of computing.

            As a prototype of projects I have done during my work, I finished the project concentrating on the analysis of grocery consumption 
            of the citizens in Hangzhou city. Online shopping and payment data were collected based on regional cases. To classify the influence 
            of human ages, the correlation analysis of age differences and shopping preferences was also conducted

            The novelist project I participated in is called Xuhui city map which analyzing the characteristics of a variety of cities using 
            intelligent algorithms. To be specific, in the project, the infomap algorithm was applied to the pedestrian tracking data between 
            cities so that cities can be divided into different communities to explore the potential connections between them; the k-means algorithm 
            was applied to city poi data, for instance, population, schools, hospitals, etc, to classify a city into 15 levels with different commercial 
            values; linear regression, random forest, and xgboosting were applied to city poi data to predict the price of the house all over the city. 
            With all the above, it was hence reasonable to predict the investment value of the undeveloped land resources if they were classified into a 
            high-value land group. Combined with other influences such as population and land prices, this model was utilized for the decision-making process in real estate companies.

            I worked as a contractor lecturer at Changzhou university for nearly two years and taught Machine Learning, Technology and Application of Enterprise Big Data, python analysis, 
            etc. To explore deeper, I specialized in the knowledge of basic models and algorithms of machine learning, for instance, KNN, K-Means, CNN, RNN, etc, and their applications. 
            I instructed students to participate in the “National College Computer Challenge Competition” and won the third prize in East China Division. The thesis was about “Correcting 
            Image Orientation Using Convolutional Neural Networks” and improving the accuracy of the model. In addition, my colleague and I completed a project, “The YOLO algorithm is applied 
            to fast recognition of face in real-time video stream”, to realize fast recognition of mask-wearing detection with lower workload and higher efficiency. Meanwhile, I had been authorized 
            to teach Big Data Technology and Application courses in an international Cooperative Program by Fairleigh Dickinson University and Zhejiang Industry Polytechnic College.
